## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Testing Tools:** Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Cucumber (BDD)  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **Approach:** Behavior Driven Development (BDD)  
- **Test Data:** Hardcoded input (some Data-Driven Testing implemented)  
- **Design Pattern:** Modular classes without PageFactory  

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

- Maven project with dependencies managed via `pom.xml`  
- Feature files (`*.feature`) written in **Gherkin syntax**  
- Test execution handled using `testng.xml` and `TestRunner.java`  
- Web interactions implemented with PageFactory
- Input data is hardcoded for each test scenario  
- Logs and reports generated via hooks and configured reporters  

---

## 🧩 Reusable Components

### `Hooks.java`

- Handles browser setup and teardown using `@Before` and `@After`
- Captures screenshots on failure
- Provides reusable utilities and global setup

### `TestRunner.java`

- Configures execution options (`features`, `glue`, `tags`)
- Integrates **Cucumber** with **TestNG** for parallel execution and reporting
